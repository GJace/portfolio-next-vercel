# Blog and stuff 

I have fully edited this on Github browser editor. I had not used it in a while and it has now become very good (Q3 2025). I think I will try to only use Github editor for this small project. It comes in very handy when I want to write on mobile devices.

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog blog

Then, run Next.js in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
